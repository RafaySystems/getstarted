# Cluster as a Service (CaaS)

This is a reference design and implementation based on Rafay's Terraform Provider to provision a RBAC controlled, dedicated operating environment for an application team/business unit using a dedicated Amazon's EKS cluster. Once successfully provisioned, we will also perform a number of day-two operations (scale node group, add new node group, upgrades) on our cluster.

Detailed documentation with step-by-step instructions are available in our [docs](https://docs.rafay.co/refarch/caas/eks/terraform/overview/)
